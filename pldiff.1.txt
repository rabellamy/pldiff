NAME
----
pldiff - Compares plist files line by line


SYNOPSIS
--------
*pldiff* 'FILE1' 'FILE2' ['OPTIONS']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The pldiff(1) command compares plist files line by line.

Because plist files are binary, diff(1) does not display the
difference between them. However, there are cases where examining
this is valuable. For example, when comparing an exising plist config
file to a backup copy before restore.

Note pldiff(1) emulates the look and feel of git's default diff,
including +/- indicators, less for vi-like viewing, and supports
colordiff(1) if installed.


OPTIONS
-------
pldiff(1) accepts all options for diff(1).
